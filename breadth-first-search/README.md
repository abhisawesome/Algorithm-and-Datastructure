# BFS (Breadth first search)

BFS is a traversing algorithm in Graph


Steps:

    1: Select any node as root node.

    2: Mark the vertex as visited if not visited previously.

    3: Append neighboring vertex to the queue

    4: remove the initial visited vertex from the queue

    4: Repeat step 2 to 4 until all the vertex are visited
