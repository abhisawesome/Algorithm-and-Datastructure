# Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
# Input: s = "abcabcbb"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3

# Input: s = "pwwkew"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
# Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
